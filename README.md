### Greetings ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brooks Townsend, I'm a software engineer backend specializing full stack engineer. All this means is that I prefer backend technologies like Rust, Elixir, and Go. I enjoy writing TypeScript and using React on the frontend, but I strongly prefer to leave graphic design and CSS to people who know what they are doing ðŸ˜„. I'm also a core maintainer for the CNCF Sandbox project [wasmCloud](https://github.com/wasmCloud/).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brooksmtownsend), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brooks-townsend/), or on [GitHub](https://github.com/brooksmtownsend)
